## Important Notes

1. **`.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) Files**  
   a. Download the raw file, then open it via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by selecting "Upload Notebook."  
   b. The notebook contains two sets of code representing:
      - **Code 1**: A *static scenario*
      - **Code 2**: A *dynamic scenario*  
   c. Code 1 will display complete results, while Code 2 allows customization according to the selected scenario.

2. **`.zip` Archive Files**  
   a. After extracting the contents, ensure no files are deleted or modified.  
   b. Open the `.html` file, or the file named **"Open here to start the simulation."**  
   c. Adjust the desired parameters, then click **"Run Simulation."**  
   d. The simulation results will be displayed immediately.
